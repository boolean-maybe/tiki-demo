# Incident Response

The incident response plan defines how the Celestia team handles drone malfunctions, security breaches, and safety events. Every incident is classified by severity and follows a structured response workflow.

## Specification

| Severity | Response Time | Escalation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 — Critical | 15 min | CTO + Safety Officer | Drone crash / injury |
| P1 — High | 1 hour | Engineering Lead | Fleet-wide comm loss |
| P2 — Medium | 4 hours | On-call engineer | Single drone RTH failure |
| P3 — Low | Next business day | Team queue | Telemetry data gap |

### *Key Policy*

> Any incident involving physical risk to people must be reported to the safety officer within 15 minutes.

## Requirements

1. All P0 incidents must have a published post-mortem within 5 business days
2. Incident response runbooks must be tested quarterly
3. FAA must be notified within 10 days for reportable incidents
4. All incidents must be tracked in the incident database

## Action Items

- [x] Define on-call rotation schedule
- [x] Create incident severity classification guide
- [ ] Build automated alert escalation
- [ ] Conduct tabletop exercise for P0 scenario
- [ ] Set up post-mortem template repository
