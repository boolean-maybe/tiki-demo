# Manufacturing Process

Each Celestia drone goes through a six-stage manufacturing pipeline from bare PCB to packaged unit. Every stage has quality gates with automated test fixtures to catch defects early.

## Specification

| Stage | Duration | Yield Target | Key Equipment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PCB Assembly | 15 min | 99.5% | Pick-and-place machine |
| Frame Build | 20 min | 99.8% | Torque-calibrated tools |
| Wiring Harness | 10 min | 99.2% | Continuity tester |
| Firmware Flash | 3 min | 99.9% | JTAG programmer |
| Functional Test | 30 min | 98.5% | Test jig + load cells |
| Packaging | 5 min | 99.9% | ESD-safe packaging line |

### *Key Policy*

> No drone may proceed to the next manufacturing stage without passing all quality gate tests.

## Requirements

1. Overall manufacturing yield must exceed 97%
2. Every unit must have a unique serial number and traceability record
3. Firmware version must be recorded at flash time
4. Functional test must validate all sensor readings within spec
5. ESD precautions must be observed at all stages

## Action Items

- [x] Design automated PCB test fixture
- [x] Order new pick-and-place feeders
- [ ] Reduce wiring harness assembly time by 20%
- [ ] Add vibration testing to functional test stage
- [x] Document rework procedures for common defects
