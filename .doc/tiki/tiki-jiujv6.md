Debugging cross-service issues requires manually correlating timestamps across five services. Adding a request-scoped correlation ID propagated via gRPC metadata and HTTP headers makes tracing straightforward.

> All infrastructure changes must go through the GitOps pipeline. Direct kubectl apply is prohibited in production. Terraform state is stored in an encrypted S3 backend with DynamoDB locking.

### Requirements

1. Telemetry ingest must sustain 50k messages/sec
2. Database failover must complete within 30 seconds
3. All services must pass health checks within 10s of startup
4. Infrastructure as Code coverage must be 100% for production

### Checklist

- [x] Migrate secrets to HashiCorp Vault
- [ ] Set up cross-region database replication
- [x] Add Prometheus alerts for NATS consumer lag
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment for API gateway
- [ ] Create disaster recovery runbook
