Multiple TOML and YAML config files govern drone behavior, comms, and safety limits. A CLI validator that checks schema conformance and cross-references between files would catch misconfigurations before deployment.

## Specification

| Config File | Format | Scope | Hot Reload |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| drone.toml | TOML | Per-vehicle | No |
| mission.yaml | YAML | Per-mission | Yes |
| safety.toml | TOML | Global | No |
| comms.toml | TOML | Per-vehicle | Partial |
| fleet.yaml | YAML | Global | Yes |

> Configuration changes to safety-critical parameters (geofence limits, failsafe thresholds, motor parameters) require a two-person approval and trigger an automatic regression test suite before deployment.

### Requirements

1. All config files must pass schema validation before loading
2. Safety-critical config changes must be dual-approved
3. Config rollback must be possible within 30 seconds
4. Default values must be documented inline in schema files

### Checklist

- [x] Define JSON Schema for all TOML config files
- [ ] Implement config diff tool for pre-deploy review
- [x] Add config versioning with git-backed history
- [ ] Build web UI for non-engineer config editing
- [ ] Create config migration scripts for v1 to v2 schema
