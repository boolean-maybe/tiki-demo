title: "Implement role-based access control for operator console"

The operator console currently has a single admin role. Compliance requires separation of duties: pilots should not be able to modify geofences, and observers should have read-only access. RBAC policies will be stored alongside the mTLS cert metadata.

## Specification

| Threat | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Command injection | Critical | mTLS + signing | In Progress |
| Telemetry spoofing | High | HMAC validation | Planned |
| Firmware tampering | Critical | Secure boot | Done |
| Replay attack | High | Nonce + timestamp | In Progress |
| Key extraction | Critical | HSM storage | Planned |

> All security-related changes must be reviewed by the security lead before merge. Vulnerability disclosures follow a 90-day responsible disclosure policy. Penetration test results are classified and stored in the restricted security vault.

### Requirements

1. All communications must use TLS 1.3 minimum
2. Client certificates must be rotated every 90 days
3. Failed authentication attempts must trigger alerts after 5 tries
4. Security audit logs must be immutable and retained for 2 years

### Checklist

- [x] Complete threat model for v2 flight controller
- [ ] Implement hardware security module integration
- [x] Set up automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Create incident response playbook for drone hijack
- [ ] Audit all API endpoints for authorization gaps
