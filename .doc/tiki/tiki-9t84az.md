title: "Implement geofence enforcement engine in mission planner"

Current geofence checks are advisory only and appear as warnings in the GCS. The mission planner must enforce hard geofence boundaries that trigger an automatic abort sequence when the drone approaches within 50m of a restricted zone.

## Implementation Reference

```lua
-- waypoint_mission.lua — survey mission for agricultural mapping
local mission = {}

local MIN_ALTITUDE = 15.0   -- meters AGL
local MAX_ALTITUDE = 120.0
local SURVEY_SPEED = 8.0    -- m/s
local PHOTO_INTERVAL = 2.0  -- seconds between captures

function mission.create_survey_grid(origin, width_m, length_m, spacing_m)
    local waypoints = {}
    local rows = math.ceil(length_m / spacing_m)

    for i = 0, rows do
        local y_offset = i * spacing_m
        local start_x, end_x

        -- serpentine pattern for efficient coverage
        if i % 2 == 0 then
            start_x, end_x = 0, width_m
        else
            start_x, end_x = width_m, 0
        end

        table.insert(waypoints, {
            lat = origin.lat + (y_offset / 111320.0),
            lon = origin.lon + (start_x / (111320.0 * math.cos(math.rad(origin.lat)))),
            alt = origin.alt,
            speed = SURVEY_SPEED,
            action = "start_capture",
        })
        table.insert(waypoints, {
            lat = origin.lat + (y_offset / 111320.0),
            lon = origin.lon + (end_x / (111320.0 * math.cos(math.rad(origin.lat)))),
            alt = origin.alt,
            speed = SURVEY_SPEED,
            action = "none",
        })
    end

    return waypoints
end

function mission.validate(waypoints)
    for idx, wp in ipairs(waypoints) do
        if wp.alt < MIN_ALTITUDE or wp.alt > MAX_ALTITUDE then
            return false, string.format("waypoint %d: altitude %.1f out of range", idx, wp.alt)
        end
    end
    return true, nil
end

return mission
```

## Specification

| Mission Type | Max Duration | Max Distance | Approval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Survey Grid | 45 min | 5 km | Auto |
| Linear Inspect | 30 min | 10 km | Pilot |
| Delivery | 20 min | 3 km | Pilot |
| Emergency SAR | 60 min | 15 km | Supervisor |
| BVLOS Test | 90 min | 20 km | Director |

> Every mission plan must pass automated safety validation before upload. Plans that violate airspace restrictions, exceed battery endurance estimates, or conflict with active NOTAMs are rejected at the planning stage.

### Requirements

1. Mission plans must be immutable once uploaded to the drone
2. Abort sequence must complete within 500ms of trigger
3. All missions must have a defined contingency landing site
4. Mission logs must be retained for a minimum of 5 years

### Checklist

- [x] Implement NOTAM integration for airspace checks
- [ ] Add battery endurance estimation to planner
- [x] Build mission template library for common patterns
- [ ] Create post-mission report generator
- [ ] Support contingency waypoints for weather diversion
